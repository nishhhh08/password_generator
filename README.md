In the modern digital landscape, where data security is of very significance, the 
generation of robust and secure passwords stands as a fundamental pillar in safeguarding 
sensitive information. 
As a part of my internship mini project; I embarked on the task of developing a python 
based solution for generating passwords that adhere to industry standard security 
practices.
Passwords stand as the Frontline defense mechanism for the user against unauthorized 
access to digital assets, marketing their generation of a critical aspect of cybersecurity 
protocols.
I have tried developing a source code for the generation of passwords of a specified 
length using a combination of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and 
punctual symbols.
